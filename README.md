# student-score-prediction
This project predicts student scores based on the number of study hours using Linear Regression.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is taken from Kaggle
.
It contains two columns:

Hours – Number of study hours

Scores – Marks obtained by students

⚙️ Project Workflow

Import dataset

Data visualization using Matplotlib/Seaborn

Train Linear Regression model

Predict student scores

Evaluate using MSE (Mean Squared Error) and R² Score

📊 Results

Achieved R² Score: 0.98 (~98% accuracy) on test data

MSE value was very small, indicating low error
